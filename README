The softwares SimBa and Simpers should work both on Linux and Windows. While they are not tested on Mac, it should still work.
First try running the binaries given in SimBa-bin. If it does not work, try installing them. See instructions below to run the binaries
Kindy install the following software for demo:
1. MeshLab (http://www.meshlab.net/) or any other Mesh viewing software as GeomView
2. Cmake-GUI(https://cmake.org/runningcmake/)
3. Boost (A C++ library: https://www.boost.org/) 
4. SimBa

Instructions to install (4) is given in its folders.
Note:
Meshlab is used to visualise the Mesh
I shal go through the installation of SimBa if need be but please install Processing, Meshlab and Boost
You can run it on the sample mesh files provided in the model folder or on your own datasets. 
Note: More CAD based Mesh files can be found online, for instance:
1. http://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/data/off/off.html  or

Instructions:
TO RUN prebuilt .exe FOR WINDOWS:
COPY the DLL file from 'SimBa-src/src/dll' to 'C:/Windows/System32/'
If you are using a 64bit machine, rename ANN64.dll to ANN.dll before copying else do the same for ANN32.dll
Rename the exe file 'SimBa' in 'SimBa-bin/windows-64' to 'SimBa.exe'
Run SimBa.exe -h in your command prompt
If it works, you are all set, use this to run SimBa.exe -i <input-file> but bringing inputs files to the same location
TO RUN prebuilt binaries for UBUNTU:
Copy libANN.a from 'SimBa-src/src/lib' to /usr/lib
Install Boost
Run SimBa in SimBa-bin by ./SimBa -h

1. Install Simba and all associated softwares
The zip file input contains the input model files
It has two formats *.off (to be input to Meshlab) and *.txt (to be used as input to SimBa)
View the *.off file in Meshlab
Input the corresponding *.txt file to Simba as: 
./SimBa -i *.txt(LINUX)
SimBa.exe -i *.txt (WINDOWS)
Simba Outputs the barcode file to persistence.txt ( or choose your own output file using -o)
View the corrsponding barcode using the python script: python barcode-create.py <filename> <no-of-bars>
