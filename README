The softwares SimBa and Simpers should work both on Linux and Windows. While they are not tested on Mac, it should still work.
Kindy install the following software for demo:
1. MeshLab (http://www.meshlab.net/) or any other Mesh viewing software as GeomView
2. Processing (https://processing.org/) To view the barcodes
3. Cmake-GUI(https://cmake.org/runningcmake/)
4. Boost (A C++ library: https://www.boost.org/) 
5. SimBa

Instructions to install (5) is given in its respective folders.
Note:
Meshlab is used to visualise the Mesh
Processing is used to see the final barcode.The file provided in the folder named processing lets you do it (I use version 2.2.1).
I shal go through the installation of SimBa if need be but please install Processing, Meshlab and Boost
You can run it on the sample mesh files provided in the model folder or on your own datasets. 
Note: More CAD based Mesh files can be found online, for instance:
